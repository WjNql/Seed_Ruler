## SeedRuler Introduction

SeedRuler is an offline software developed in Python, leveraging YOLO, Segment-anything, and deep learning methods. It is designed for high-precision measurement of rice seed germination and seed size.

SeedRuler offers an intuitive user interface for acquiring rice seed images, precisely positioning and segmenting seeds, determining seed germination status, and generating output data for seed quantity and germination rate for all captured images. Users can employ images with seeds in contact, significantly enhancing user convenience.

We also provide you with an online service version of SeedRuler. Please visit [seedruler](https://u263790-ad15-4e65cb7d.westc.gpuhub.com:8443/IMSFGM) for more information.



## SeedRuler Usage

### YOLO_Function

When employing the YOLO_Function, initiate the process by clicking the YOLO_Function button on the SeedRuler main interface, thereby accessing the function-specific interface. Subsequently, opt for a designated folder through the "Select Folder" option, facilitating the batch processing of images. Execute the program by activating the "Run" button, upon which completion of the program will be indicated by the presentation of an output folder. Initial insights into the output results can be obtained for preliminary assessment, while a more comprehensive examination of information can be undertaken within the output folder.

### SAM_Function

When utilizing the SAM_Function, initiate the process by clicking the SAM_Function button on the SeedRuler main interface, which will transition to the function-specific interface. SAM_Function operates based on the results generated by the YOLO_Function. Within the SAM_Function interface, users can opt to choose individual grain images from the output files of YOLO_Function by selecting the "Select File" option. Alternatively, users may choose labeled grain images from the YOLO_Function output and manually select a specific grain by utilizing the "Select Through Image" option. Upon completion of the selection, activate the "Save Results" button to execute the program. Post-execution, an output folder will be displayed, allowing for a preliminary preview of the results. Furthermore, a more comprehensive examination of information can be conducted within the output folder.
